# Confidential ML Utilities

![Python package](https://github.com/Azure/confidential-ml-utils/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

Confidential ML is the practise of training machine learning models without
seeing the training data. It is needed in many enterprises to satisfy the
strict compliance and privacy guarantees they provide to their customers. This
repository contains a set of utilities for confidential ML, with a special
emphasis on using PyTorch in
[Azure Machine Learning pipelines](https://aka.ms/pl-concept).
