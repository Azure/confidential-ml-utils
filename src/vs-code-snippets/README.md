## VS Code Snippets

[Code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns.

We provide a collection of snippets useful for working with AML. Add these snippets to VS Code as follows: `ctrl+shift+p` > `config user snippets` > `python`. This will open a `python.json` file with your configured snippets.
